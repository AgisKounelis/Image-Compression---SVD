# Image Compression - SVD
Image Compression using Singular-value decomposition.
Download .jar file here: https://kounelisagis.com/SVD.jar

# Development
Eclipse, Java, Swing, OjAlgo Java library

# Project Summary
The program takes an image as input converts it to three same dimension matrices (Red, Green, Blue),
representing each pixel's rgb value, and then excecutes SVD on every matrix.
After that user makes selection of the number of Singular Values to keep and then three same dimension matrices are composed
and so is the new image. There is a live preview of the image as well as an option for save.
